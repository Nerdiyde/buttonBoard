# buttonBoard - A multipurpose ESP32 powered IOT/Smart Home button PCB

The ButtonBoard PCB is my attempt to kill several birds with one stone. On the one hand, Iâ€™ve always been looking for a universal and easy-to-program remote control for the often very individual control options in my smart home. On the other hand, I wanted to have a simple way of equipping my projects (for example the  **_[pxlBlck project](https://nerdiy.de/en/pxlblck/)_**) with a physical operating option.

Currently, the various  **_[pxlBlck platforms](https://nerdiy.de/en/tag/pxlblckplattform/)_**  can only be controlled via the serial interface or an existing WiFi connection.

Unfortunately, this means that it is difficult to give away these projects (for example) as present. At least not to people who are not interested in Arduino, electronics and co. Or at least can / want to deal with them when it is needed to adjust the different settings.

I want to solve this disadvantage with the ButtonBoard. ðŸ™‚
